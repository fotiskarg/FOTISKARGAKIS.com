        <p>Hello to all. In this page you will learn some informations about me!!!
        </p>
            First of all , I would like to analyze my profile.
            I am a graduate of the Department of Production Engineering and Management of the International University of Greece. 
            The period 2014 to 2019 I finished with the undergraduate program of the Department of Automation Engineering of ATEITH.
            In the year 2017-2018 I studied at the HAMK of Finland, in matters concerning the programming and structure of PLCs, the use of Scada, design with AutoCAD, wireless networks and PID systems.
            I am from Greece, I live in Thessaloniki and I am 26 years old. I am currently working on a biological project related to wastewater treatment. There I have various responsibilities such as supervising fourteen pumping stations in the eastern city.
            The control and operation of the pumping stations is achieved with the management of Scada.
            I also deal with plc programming, while also locating and resolving electrical faults.
            In my free time I create projects related to the web design part. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, C ++. Below you will find the links for some of my projects. Architecture such as networks, TCP / IP, HTTP, back-end and front-end construction are some of the additional knowledge I have.
